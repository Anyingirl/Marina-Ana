              <h3>Pros</h3>
                <li><p>When you eat healthy (and it can be vegan, vegetarian or none of these) you can be helping animals and the environment so it can keep people who are worried about environmental prolems motivated.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>You realize the disadvantages of living an unhealthy life from another perspective.</p></li>
                <li><p>It can also give you self-confidence, beacuse being healthy means being in sintony with your body and your mind.
                  That´s why we need mental health too; a good, healthy and fit body doesn´t match a contaminated mind.</p></li>
                <li><p>You will stay fit during all the year and it will also help you to be confident with your body and with yourself in general.
                  This is because although people say that "apperance it´s not everything" and "people are prettier in the inside", we are all worried about our physical apperance sometime.</p></li>

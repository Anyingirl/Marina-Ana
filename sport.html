            <h2>SUMMER SPORTS</h2>
            <p>We all know what summer vacations are made of: the sea, mojitos, paellas and friends. But we also know where will all that paella go when we go back to work.
            This is why it is important to stay fit, even when it´s that time of the year when we want the most to be lazy and spend all the holidays in the beach.
            Although we know it is hard, we have a solution for you: to fight that lazines we will use fun! We did some research to find the best sports to mix fun and ways to stay healthy all the summer.
            With these sports you will be able to keep fit and to get that beach body you didn´t have time to get all over the year.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Surf</strong></li>
              <p>It is hard to dominate the surfboard and at the beggining you might fall almost all the time but once you get it, it can be so fun.
               It is highly recommended for people with balance, patience fearless and with initiative.
              </p>
              <li><strong>Swimming</strong></li>
              <p>It can seem pretty easy at first because we are used to swim in swimming pools all around the year, but I dare you to swim in the sea with the tides the currents and the waves.
              Only the bravest dare to go swimming while they are in the beach. (The bravest and the least lazy because a mojito in the sand will always be the easy option).
              So take note of these people and go swimming for a while everywhere you, a pool or the sea, everything counts.
              </p>
              <li><strong>Biking</strong></li>
              <p>It's a great time of the year to grab your bike and go for a ride. Whether you play professionally or just for fun, your bike is begging to be used.
              Also, when you go with the bike is when you can appreciate the best views of the countryside, the beach or jjust your everyday town but seen from a different perspective.
              </p>
              <li><strong>Running</strong></li>
              <p>Everything might require running at some point, so why not join in. All you need is some tennis shoes and you're off. If you're up for it, sign up for a mini-marathon near you to really get your heart pumping.
              You can also feel better after a run if you had a bad day.
              </p>
              <li><strong>Yoga</strong></li>
              <p>This is considered a sport although you might think it is not. It is recomended for people with high levels of stress, anxiety or fury.
              It is thought to be a relaxing way to keep fit and mentally healthy. It requires felixibility and patience.
